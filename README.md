## 💻 Chosen Stack: Go (Backend) + Prometheus (Metrics) + Grafana (Dashboard) + ELK Stack (Logs)

For **Armora TurretGuard**, we're going with a robust, high-performance, and widely adopted stack that's known for its scalability and reliability in monitoring complex systems.

* **Core Backend (Go):** Go (Golang) is an excellent choice for the main TurretGuard agent and server components due to its superior performance, concurrency model (goroutines), and low memory footprint. It's ideal for building efficient data collectors and processing engines.
* **Metrics Collection (Prometheus):** A leading open-source monitoring system designed for reliability and scalability. Prometheus will be used for collecting time-series metrics from monitored targets.
* **Metrics Visualization (Grafana):** The ultimate open-source platform for data visualization and monitoring. Grafana will provide the "berbinar-binar" dashboards to display metrics collected by Prometheus.
* **Log Aggregation & Analysis (ELK Stack):** A powerful combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. This will handle log collection, processing, storage, and visualization, making it perfect for security event monitoring and anomaly detection.

## 🛠️ Installation & Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the core components of Armora TurretGuard. We'll assume a Linux-based server (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) for deployment.

### Phase 1: Core Backend - Armora TurretGuard Agent/Server (Go)

The Go application will act as a custom agent or central processing unit for specific monitoring tasks and integrations.

#### 1. Requirements

* **Go Language:** Version 1.20 or newer.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.
* **`make`:** For building the project.
* **`gcc` (or other C compiler):** Required by some Go dependencies.

#### 2. Installation Steps

##### a. Clone the Armora TurretGuard Repository

First, get the source code onto your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Armora-Security/TurretGuard.git
cd TurretGuard
```
*(Replace `Armora-Security/TurretGuard.git` with the actual repository URL when created)*

##### b. Install Go Language (if not already installed)

```bash
# Recommended: Use official tarball for latest version
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz # Check for latest version on golang.org/dl
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Set up Go environment variables (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile)
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go' >> ~/.bashrc # Standard Go workspace
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc # Apply changes
```
Verify Go installation: `go version`

##### c. Build Armora TurretGuard Executables

Navigate to the project root and build the Go application. This will compile the source code into executable binaries.

```bash
# Assuming TurretGuard has modular components (e.g., agent and server)
go mod tidy # Clean up go.mod and download dependencies
go build -o bin/turretguard-agent ./cmd/agent   # Build the agent
go build -o bin/turretguard-server ./cmd/server # Build the server component (if central)

# Or, if it's a single binary:
# go build -o bin/turretguard-app ./cmd/main
```
The compiled binaries will be located in the `bin/` directory.

#### 3. Usage (Initial Run - Go Components)

* **Running the Agent:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/turretguard-agent --config /etc/turretguard/agent.yaml
    ```
* **Running the Server/Processor:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/turretguard-server --config /etc/turretguard/server.yaml
    ```
*(Configuration files like `agent.yaml` and `server.yaml` will need to be created based on the project's design.)*

### Phase 4: Integrating TurretGuard with Monitoring Systems

This phase involves configuring your Armora TurretGuard Go applications to send data to Prometheus and Logstash/Elasticsearch.

* **Metrics Integration:**
    * Ensure your `turretguard-agent` and `turretguard-server` Go applications expose metrics in Prometheus format (e.g., using `github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus`).
    * Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from these TurretGuard endpoints (update `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`).
* **Log Integration:**
    * **Filebeat:** Deploy Filebeat (Elastic Agent) on the same servers where your TurretGuard Go applications are running. Filebeat will collect logs from TurretGuard's log files and forward them to Logstash (or directly to Elasticsearch).
    * Configure Filebeat to monitor the log paths of your TurretGuard applications and ship them to your Logstash input on port 5044.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

* **Firewall:** Always configure your server's firewall (e.g., UFW, `firewalld`) to only allow necessary ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 9090 for Prometheus, 3000 for Grafana, 5601 for Kibana) from trusted IPs.
* **Authentication:** Secure all components with strong, unique passwords. Never use default credentials.
* **Root Access:** Understand that `install.sh` and many monitoring tools require root. Limit access and follow security best practices.
* **Proprietary Software:** Remember Armora TurretGuard's proprietary nature. Ensure compliance with its `LICENSE.txt` for any usage.
